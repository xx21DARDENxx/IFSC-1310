        <h3>Progressive Enhancement</h3>
        <p>Progressive Enhancement is a strategy that helps you build a website in layers. The article compares this to a peanut m&m. The peanut is the HTML. Starting your website by making sure all of the html is done first makes it so that it your content will be accessible to everyone. Then the css is the chocolate. This is what starts making your website look and feel unique depending on the design goals for the site. The final layer is the hard candy outer shell, or the javascript. This is where all the cool tricks come into play. Make sure to build you website up like this makes it so that no matter what machine a person might be using, it will always be accessible to them. </p>
        <h3>Spacex Feedback and Reflection</h3>
        <p>I really enjoyed making this site and had a lot of fun. Some of the feedback I got was to add some different padding and spacing around certain elements to make the overall layout look more fleshed out. I know I am not the most design oriented, but after looking at the SpaceX original site, I saw a lot of dark colors and themes, so I decided to stick with that for my header and footer. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I am glad with how it turned out.</p>
