    <h3>Campus living</h3>
    
    <p>UA Little Rock provides a variety of on-campus living options for students ranging from traditional resident rooms to multiple-bedroom apartments.

    <h4>Athletics</h4>
    
    <p>UA Little Rock's 14 athletic teams are known as the Little Rock Trojans, with almost all teams participating in the Sun Belt Conference. Little Rock is one of two Sun Belt members that do not sponsor football (UT Arlington being the other); UA Little Rock last fielded a football team in 1955 when it was known as Little Rock Junior College. Little Rock's main athletic offices are located in the Jack Stephens Center. UA Little Rock offers the following sports:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Baseball</li>
    <li>Men's and Women's Basketball</li>
    <li>Men's and Women's Golf</li>
    <li>Women's Volleyball</li>
    <li>Women's Soccer</li>

    </ol>
    <p>Two Little Rock teams that do not compete in the Sun Belt are the women's swimming and diving team (Missouri Valley Conference) and wrestling (Pac-12 Conference), neither of which the Sun Belt sponsors.
